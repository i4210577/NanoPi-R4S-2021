# NanoPi-R4S-2021 The plug-in and kernel version are automatically updated every day.
## ``` Since the source code could not be taken out of the hard disk, I had to do it again. , At present, only 70% of the reconstruction progress is used on the closed source of this mirror. Try to deal with it later. The following things have been updated this month.
## Samsung TF card\Haikang TF card is strongly recommended. Even if the firmware is difficult to flash, only Samsung flashes it to boot.
### Note: Do not use to restore the backup. . There is no guarantee that a certain plug-in will work properly. . . It is recommended to reset the thief! ! !
This month I have been begging without a computer (please be in the computer~). . .

## Tips
 -My firmware has added dynamic overclocking. Whether it is hot or not, it depends on what the background program is running.
 -If it feels very hot, add a fan. It is recommended that the fan is 6cm×6cm, thinner 1cm, USB is also OK, or terminal cable zh1.5
